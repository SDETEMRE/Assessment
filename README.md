# HomePage Example: Cypress in JavaScript

This is Automation Test Samples for HomePage of a Website.
It shows how to make an automating test with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) in JavaScript.

It uses:

* [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) as the programming language
* [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for browser automation
* [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/downloads/) as the local browser for testing
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) for dependency management

To run this example project, you'll need:

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16 or higher
2. A good JavaScript editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/javascript)
3. Up-to-date versions of the following browsers:
   * [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
   * [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
   * [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge)

Clone this repository

To install project dependencies run:

```
npm install
```

Then, to open the Cypress window for launching tests, run:

```
npx cypress open
```

If you want to run tests directly from the command line, run this instead:

```
npx cypress run
```
* You may use scripsts to run all the tests and get Mochawesome Report : They are all inside of the package.json file/scripts

* Once you run that script you may find the report inside of the mochawesome-report folder (mochawesome.html)
